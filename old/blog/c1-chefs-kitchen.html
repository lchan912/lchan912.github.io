  <h1>Chef's Kitchen</h1>
  <h2>Taking matters into my own hands</h2>

  I've never been much of a cook. The best I've done is bowl water for ramen and fry an egg to go with my ramen. But in the DBC welcoming video from Shereef, I took away a fundamental lesson that I need throughout my time at DBC and in the community of developers. That is, in the world of learning and making phenomenal experiences for myself, I need to become one of the chefs in the kitchen and not just sit back, waiting to be served. 
  </p>
  <p>
  With that idea in mind, I plan to look for and create opportunities for valuable contributions to everybody's learning, such as providing constructive criticism, presenting innovative ideas, asking questions, and helping others. The end goal for me is that by the end of 9-weeks of intensive training, I would have a chef's mindset and attitude in terms of taking charge of my own learnings. Specifically, I'm looking to build a set of healthy habits and practices that would not only benefit myself but the community in general. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Speaking of healthy habits, another important takeaway I had of the video is that I'll come away from DBC is a junior programmer who will likely not be hired for my technical expertise but for the engineering empathy and curiosity to learn and adapt in high-stress and high-intensity environments. I will learn to work well with fellow programmers and catch on to new concepts more quickly. I will also have plenty of practice researching and figuring out challenges on my own. What I learn, I will share with others through blogs, presentations, and other mediums. All of the above are important building blocks and ingredients to being a successful and lasting contributor of an interactive developers' community.
  </p>
    <p>
  I am so glad I'm taking this step and changing my life.
