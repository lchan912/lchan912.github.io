  <h1>Tips When Asking Questions</h1>
  <h2>Maximize your chances of getting a valuable response!</h2>
  <h4>June 28, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      Remember the last time you saw unclear, cryptic questions on StackOverflow or other resources? It can be frustrating piecing apart the question and make assumptions when trying to understand if the question is relevant to you. You also don't want to be the one posting questions that are more likely to be ignored. Here's a couple of tips to help you out:
    </p>
    <h3>1) Research for an answer first!</h3>
    <p>
      This may sound obvious but I felt like I needed to put this out there anyways. Do your due diligence to make sure your question/situation is unique and hadn't already been answered. Be creative about what your research for and make notes about what you find so that if you do post a question you can describe how your question differs from what's already been answered. 
    </p>
    <h3>2) Summarize your question in the title</h3>
    <p>
      The title is what catches users' attention. Spend time on writing a short but descriptive title in the form of a question. Make sure you have the correct spelling, punctuation, and grammar. If you're having a hard time coming up with the title, save it for last and write the rest of your question first. Here are some examples of good and bad titles:
      <ul>
        <li>BAD: C# Math Confusion</li>
        <li>GOOD: Why does using float instead of int give me different results when all of my inputs are integers?</li>
        <li>BAD: android if else problems</li>
        <li>GOOD: Why does str == "value" evaluate to false when str is set to "value"?</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>3) Describe what your TRYING to do and what it's ACTUALLY doing</h3>
    <p>
      Make it obvious what you are trying to accomplish. Don't just make statements like: when I do X, I get an error. Tell the users what you are expecting X to do then give the users details on how and at what point did it stop working. 
    </p>
    <h3>4) Help others reproduce the problem</h3>
    <p>
      Include just enough sample code for others to copy and paste the code into an editor and reproduce the exact same problem. Avoid including code that has nothing to do with the problem. Also make sure the sample code is standalone (if possible). The goal is to make it as easy and painless as possible for another user to encounter the same problem as you did. 
    </p>
    <h3>5) Proof-read</h3>
    <p>
      Lastly, proof-read your question for spelling, punctuation, grammar, and capitalization mistakes. Also, read your question as if you are encountering it for the first time. Are there any gray areas that you need to clarify? Are you making any assumptions that wasn't specified? Does your question makes sense overall?
