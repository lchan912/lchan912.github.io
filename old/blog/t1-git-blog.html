      Imagine being handed a time machine. Imagine going back in time to those drunken mistakes or poor judgment calls or life-long regrets. What if technology allowed you to change history as if it never happened and you could now live in an alternative utopia universe?  That’s where version control comes in…to some extent.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the world of documentations and programming source codes, version control allows the writer/programmer to create snapshots in the lifecycle of documents and, at any point in time, return to any snapshot of the document as needed. This is helpful for when an author/programmer makes additions or edits to a particular document and later on decides against their changes. Version controls let’s them return the document to a previous snapshot prior and begin anew.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another perk of version control is that, in the world of programming, it allows developers to collaborate on the same code. So long as each developer extracts their own copies of the code and write helpful comments in tracking their changes, they can later merge various copies of the code to create one master copy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Speaking of tracking changes, a command line technology called ‘git’ facilitates change tracking as part of the whole version control process. How git works is that it tracks file modifications, additions, and deletions made by developers in their own version of the code. Prior to allowing the developer to publish his code for review by his fellow teammates, git enables the developer to make comments about what he changed and how it will benefit the overall code. Git then lets the developer push his changes for review by the team and eventually incorporates his changes in the master code.
    </p>
    <p>
        So how does a team actually access each member’s code changes? Perhaps they email back and forth and assign one person to review all the submissions before merging the copies together… Or perhaps there’s a web app for that. GitHub allows for storing codes online to be accessed from any computer connected to the Internet. Developers around the world can store their code on GitHub so that they can review, make comments, revisions, and finally merge verions of code together while only needing to accesses a single web application. Developers can also contribute to their favorite open source projects more easily and build off each other’s knowledge by examining how other developers program.
    </p>
    <p>
        By leveraging version control, git, and GitHub, developers are making their lives easier and the world smaller in that collaboration is in full force. In the end, these tools allow for more brainpower to create better and more efficient programs.
