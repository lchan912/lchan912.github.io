  <h1>Conflict</h1>

      Recently, on my job I was tasked with collecting on a water bill from a tenant who was renting a retail space. However, the tenant continuously pushed back and used delay tatics such as requesting for additional information like water meter readings for the past 6 months. Not only did I have to spend time and effort to gather his requested information, he did not even have the courtesy to review the information prior to our next scheduled meeting. All in all, I met with him 3 times and each time he admitted to not having reviewed the information and requesting for more information. The conflict is on-going and in our last conversation he redirected me to schedule a discussion with his senior. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The source of the conflict was that I felt he was not valuing my time and effort. He continuously requested useless information that will not contribute to the next steps. Also, despite his insistent that I produce the information for him, he did not value my effort enough to review the information prior to our next scheduled meeting. I felt highly disrespected and irritated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the conflict has yet to resolve, I feel like I've made progress with a polite and persistent attitude. I will be speaking with the senior and at the time, I will have all my facts sent over so that there will be no more gathering of unnecessary information. I learned that in order to get the cooperation that I want, I have to maintain my cool at all times. If something is bothering me personally, I should tactful bring it up so that the other person is at least aware.
