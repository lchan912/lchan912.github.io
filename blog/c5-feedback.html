  <h1>Pairing Feedback</h1>
  <h2>The business of people</h2>

      Overall I find pairing with others to solve challenges is a challenge in and of itself. I am often anxious and worried during the pairing session thinking about if I'm being overbearing or if I'm not contributing enough or how best to disagree and get my point across. My mind is too clouded with thoughts like that to really study and digest the exercise at hand. More than once, my partner and I would spend over 30 minutes troubleshooting in vain together before giving up for a short break. During the break, I'd breathe a sigh of relief before realizing that a simple fix is actually staring at me in the face. Had my mind not been a cluster of self-conscious thoughts, we may have been finished with the challenge 30 minutes ago.

      That being said, there are advantages to pairing. I have learned much about working with others and facilitating pairing sessions. Surprisingly, I come from a consultant background and working with others was a big part of my day job. However, through these pairing sessions, I've realized that I still have a long ways to go in terms of communicating my thoughts and actively listening to others while keeping my mind clear.

      I appreciate all the feedback I received from the pairing sessions. It was helpful to see where I can improve on and I'd certainly like to make sure I show respect and consideration to all my partner at all times, not just most of the time. Out of all the metrics we are measured by, that is the one I care about the most. Like I mentioned earlier, I do not want to come off as overbearing and controlling. The other metric that I especially care about is benefiting the team/pair culturally. To work on this aspect of my pairing, I plan to be positive and inspiring in the face of even the most difficult exercises. If I find myself getting frustrated, I plan to take a step back and ask for a short break before returning ready with a conducive attitude.

      When asked to write feedback for others, I find that I have an easier time writing positive experiences about the pairing than I do writing constructive criticisms. Perhaps this is just part of human nature to avoid conflicts. Though I've been working on changing my mindset so that I can be helpful to others in letting them know my experiences with them.
