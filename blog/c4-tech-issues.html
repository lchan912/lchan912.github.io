  <h1>Data Breaches</h1>
  <h2>Exactly who knows your social, contact, and credit card info?</h2>
  <h4>May 23, 2014</h4>

      Home Depot, JP Morgan Chase, Target, Ebay, and Anthem suffered some of the largest volume of data breaches in the last year. Home Depot lost credit card data of 56 million customers. Target alone lost data of 70 million customers and chances were, you might have been one of them. Ebay and Chase lost access of highly sensitive computers that contained large volumes of customer data. The issue of data breach appears to be systematic across all industries. So what are companies doing (if anything) to protect your data?
    </p>
    <p>
      Ironically, as computers become more prevalent and necessary in the running of companies and the day-to-day lives of consumers, data security concerns have also become increasingly relevant and top-of-mind. Heavy reliance on online shopping, banking, paperless bill payments and other convenient digital age developments have given consumers a false sense of comfort. Convenience does not mean security. 
    </p>
    <p>
      When websites prompt you for credit card number and/or social security number and/or your mother's maiden name, just where does that information go? And who has access to it? And most importantly, is anyone protecting it?
    </p>
    <p>
    For the most part large companies are now investing in both internal security teams and  external team of security consultants led by the company's Chief Technology Officer or Chief Information Security Officer. These teams are responsible for making sure that reasonable and sufficient security measures are in place to protect sensitive data at the time of collection, transportation through the Internet and their internal network, as well as at short and long term storage locations. Available to security teams are number of data encryption tools, user access control mechanisms, security monitoring services. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Encryption tools are primarily used for hiding sensitive data through the use of math algorithms that turn the data into gibberish characters. Only by knowing or having access to the password/key can a person unencrypted the data...unless the person cracks the password or the encryption algorithm. User access control mechanism is a method to control who has access/permission to what and who has done what to which file. For example, a cashier should not have permission to void payments as this promotes a conflict of interest.
    </p>
    <p>
    Lastly, security monitoring services include a breathed of softwares and applications that allow security professionals to detect abnormalities in network traffic, computer usage, or application behaviors. These abnormalities can indicate malicious activities. However, the issue with monitoring services is that the technology can only do so much. It is up to the professionals to determine if indeed the company is under attack and what measure to be taking place to stop and prevent further damage.
