   I am looking forward to the DBC experience and making the most of it. Like Shereef’s said, it’s about having the right mindset and becoming part of a member of the chef's kitchen staff and not the consumer. As for the pairing and group dynamics at DBC, I am an introvert and working and spending time with others can sometimes be draining. However, I have worked in consulting and know the importance of soft skills and social empathy. For nine weeks, I am prepared to really step out of my comfort zone and grow in the social and technical aspects of my life. I plan to meet and connect with every member of the cohort and develop strong bonds during my stay. As for the technical learning, I understand that this is only the beginning and that what I’ll be learning is the building blocks to become an actual programmer. Shereef was right in that what I’ll have to offer after I graduate isn’t my technical expertise but my knack for engineering empathy and curiosity to learn and adapt. I have high hopes in myself for the next 12 weeks.
