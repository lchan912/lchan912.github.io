  <h1>Thinking Style</h1>
  <h2>A Concrete Sequential Learner</h2>
  <h4>May 17th, 2015</h4>

      I fit the description of concrete sequential learner almost to a T. I learn best in orderly environments where the instructions are clear and follow a logical sequence. I struggle when pulled into seemingly pointless and non-linear discussions. Knowing this, I would probably learn best if I take lessons in DBC in digestible chucks that build one on top of the other.

      During Phase 0, I struggled most with time management and self-discipline. I eventually had to utilize the moosti time application in order to get any work done. The course-flow itself seems to fit with my learning style as the agenda for the week seems very orderly and manageable. I like that each weeks seems to focus on one specific learning topic.

      However, all that being said, I am very open to adapting to other styles of thinking. I do not believe everything in this world, especially in the world of programming, will be delivered in a sequential and linear fashion. For example, after working in the IT service industry, I know firsthand that the client will most likely not know what their business requirements are. They provide only vague and unclear outlines of what they think they want. Hence, many conversations I've had in the past are circular and actual useful information are gleamed in small, non-linear chunks. I believe that with practice, I can learn to adapt and maybe even thrive in the abstract environment.
