  <h1>Battling Stereotype Threats</h1>
  <h2>Self-Affirmation</h2>
  <h4>June 13th, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      Stereotype Threat by Claude M. Steele argues that minorities can protect themselves from stereotype threat by practicing self-affirmation. This can be done through deliberate focus on values and skills that are important to themselves. In this blog, I will practice self-affirmation in hope of combating stereotype threat during my stay at San Francisco.
    </p>
    <p>
      Values that are important to me:
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>Values</td>
          <td>How well I do</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Accomplishments</td>
          <td>4</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Dependability</td>
          <td>5</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Competence</td>
          <td>3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Fairness</td>
          <td>4</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Coolness under fire</td>
          <td>2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Personal Development</td>
          <td>3</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all the values, dependability is one of the most important one to me. There's rarely occasions to question and distrust someone who is known for being dependable and reliable. When I say I will do something, you can rest assure that it'll be done and done well. In every day life, I show this by being punctual, getting errands done on time, and only accepting work and the volume of work that I'm comfortable with. My expectations of others are similar in that if they have committed to do something; I rely on them heavily to get it done. And I know others rely on me as well and I hate letting people down so I highly value dependability.

    Recently a friend talked to me about fairness at work in a restaurant. The bartenders always seem to earn more in tip and the servers have to tip them out at the end of the night as well. I greatly value fairness in all environments. When she described the scenario though, I did not think it was all that unfair. We talked about the level of skills and training the bartenders must acquire in order to be competent enough to earn good tips. We also talked about the level of responsibility and duties that the bartenders must assume that are well above and beyond those of the servers'. At the end of the discussion, we mutually agreed that in terms of fairness, so long as she has an equal opportunity to train and work as a bartender then all is fair to her.

    Through writing this blog, I feel like a made progress in defending myself against stereotype threats. I have to constantly remind myself of what values are important to me and how I can get better at living those values. Other exercises that I would recommend include being aware of the stereotypes that I maybe placing on others. I recommend looking for examples of people that are far from stereotypical and let them break our preconceived notions.
