  <h1>Stereotype Threats</h1>
  <h2>Asian Female</h2>
  <h4>June 7, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      Growing up, I was expected by people around me to excel at school (especially math), to fail at driving, to be subjected to strict parenting, and to aspire to one of three professions: medical doctor, accountant, or engineer. And of course, being the extraordinary person that I am, I met none of those expectations. 
    </p>
    <p>
      School was a place where I performed average. Ok, maybe a bit above average, if I were to be completely honest. But only by a little bit. Truly. I was two levels behind in terms of math. Skating by in my science courses and sleeping through my history lessons. Of course, I also joined volunteer groups in order to fill out the extra-curricular section of college applications but I was never in any leadership positions. Oh, and I was never in band or orchestra. I may be slightly tone deaf. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to my academic achievement (or lack thereof) and the frequent 'uh...' response to situations where a bit of math is involved, I've been called many times a 'failed Asian' jokingly by my friends. And of course, I've also been subject to the phrase "but you're ASIAN!" I am. Asian. That's why I know martial arts. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall though, I believe the Asian stereotype helped me do better than I actually would have in school. I cared about fitting in with my Asian friends and I was competitive enough to not want to be the "least Asian" person in my class. To top it off, I was aiming to get an MD because that's what my parents would have liked and what my Asian friends were gunning for as well. That goal was quickly dashed, after my first semester of organic chemistry at the University of Georgia. I went into business, where most of my fellow classmates were not Asian...

      Aside from school, I had to deal with people judging my driving skills. I must say, I am no more worse than an average person. I have had more than twice as few accidents as my brother but each time I get into one, my brother's friends blame my gender and my ethnicity. Which has nothing to do with anything...
